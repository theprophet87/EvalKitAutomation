# EvalKitAutomation
Scripts to automate process for course evaluations at WTS
This project's aim is to automate as much as possible the process of transfering the data from Evaluation Kit's course survey results from the raw data files (in Excel spreadsheet format) to a master Google sheet. 
The project hopes to accomplish the automation particularly of pulling relevant course information, performing relevant calculations, and allowing the processes of multiple spreadsheets at once in an effort to minimize the time spent on this process throughout the academic year. If possible, there may also be a GUI element which will relinquish the need for staff to access the script itself
